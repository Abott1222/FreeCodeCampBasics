<!--
1. I can see a <main> element with a corresponding id="main-doc", which contains the page's main content (technical documentation). X
2. Within the #main-doc ( <main> ) element, I can see several <section> elements, each with a class of "main-section". There should be a minimum of 5. X
3. The first element within each .main-section should be a <header> element which contains text that describes the topic of that section  X





4. Each <section> element with the class of "main-section" should also have an id that corresponds with the text of each <header> contained within it. Any spaces should be replaced with underscores (e.g. The <section> that contains the header "Javascript and Java" should have a corresponding id="Javascript_and_Java"). ‣
5. The .main-section elements should contain at least 10 <p> elements total (not each). X
6. The .main-section elements should contain at least 5 <code> elements total (not each). ‣
7. The .main-section elements should contain at least 5 <li> items total (not each). ‣
8. I can see a <nav> element with a corresponding id="navbar". ‣
9. The first element within the navbar should be a <header> which contains text that describes the topic of the technical documentation. ‣
10. Additionally, the navbar should contain link (<a>) elements with the class of "nav-link". There should be one for every element with the class "main-section". ‣
11. Each element with the class of "nav-link" should contain text that corresponds to the <header> text within each <section> (e.g. if you have a "Hello world" section/header, your navbar should have an element which contains the text "Hello world"). ‣
12. When I click on a navbar element, the page should navigate to the corresponding section of the "main-doc" element (e.g. If I click on a "nav-link" element that contains the text "Hello world", the page navigates to a <section> element that has that id and contains the corresponding <header>. ‣


#Layout
1. On regular sized devices (laptops, desktops), the element with id="navbar" should be shown on the left side of the screen and should always be visible to the user. ‣
2. My Technical Documentation page should use at least one media query.
